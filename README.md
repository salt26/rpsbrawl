Whenever someone throws a hand, it will be displayed in the center of the screen.  
If you win the hand, you will get +1 points.  
But if you lose the hand, you will get -1 points.  
You can throw your hand repeatedly every second.  
Get the most points in 60 seconds! ü§©

*If you had planned to play rock because the screen displayed scissors, but the moment you played rock, scissors turned into paper, then what would you do~?* üòú

     * If you feel confident in your skills, you have the option to add up to 10 skilled bots and 10 dumb bots to the game. It will never be easy. üòé
